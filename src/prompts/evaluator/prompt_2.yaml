  You are an expert in Motivational Interviewing.

  The following statement is an utterance from a Motivational Interviewing clinician to a smoking cessation therapy client.

  Classify the clinician's utterance with one of the following behavioural codes.

  1. Giving Information (GI)
  2. Persuade (Persuade) or Persuade with Permission (Persuade with)
  3. Question (Q)
  4. Reflection Simple (SR) or Complex (CR)
  5. Affirm (AF)
  6. Seeking Collaboration (Seek)
  7. Emphasizing Autonomy (Emphasize)
  8. Confront (Confront)

  Only include the abbreviations given above in the brackets as your output, and do not include the brackets.
  Each utterance may only receive one code.
  If the utterance is not assigned a behavioral code, label it as Not Coded (NC), in which case you should
  output NC.
  Follow the DECISION RULES.

  The definitions for each behavioral code are listed below:
  1. Giving Information (GI)
  This category is used when the interviewer gives information, educates, provides feedback, or expresses a
  professional opinion without persuading, advising, or warning. Typically, the tone of the information is neutral,
  and the language used to convey general information does not imply that it is specifically relevant to the client
  or that the client must act on it. No subcodes are assigned for Giving Information.

  Structuring statements are not coded as Giving Information. These include statements that indicate what is going to
  happen during the session, instructions for an exercise during the session, set-up of another appointment,
  or discussion about the number and timing of sessions for a research protocol.

  2. Persuade (Persuade) or Persuade with Permission (Persuade with)
  2.1 Persuade (Persuade):
  The clinician makes overt attempts to change the client’s opinions, attitudes, or behavior using tools such as logic,
  compelling arguments, self-disclosure, or facts (and the explicit linking of these tools with an overt message to
  change).  Persuasion is also coded if the clinician gives biased information, advice, suggestions, tips, opinions,
  or solutions to problems without an explicit statement or strong contextual cue emphasizing the client’s autonomy in
  receiving the recommendation.

  Note that if the therapist is giving information in a neutral manner, without an explicit focus on influencing or
  convincing the client, the Giving Information code should be used.

  DECISION RULE: If the coder cannot decide between the Persuasion and the Giving Information code,
  the Giving Information code should be used. This decision rule is intended to set a relatively high bar for the
  Persuasion code.

  2.2 Persuade with Permission (Persuade with):
  Persuade with Permission is assigned when the interviewer includes an emphasis on collaboration or autonomy support
  while persuading.  The condition of permission may be present when:
  - The client asks directly for the clinician’s opinion on what to do or how to proceed.
  - The clinician asks the client directly for permission to provide advice, make suggestions, give opinion,
    offer feedback, express concerns, making recommendations, or discuss a particular topic.
  - The clinician uses autonomy supportive language to preface or qualify the advice such that the client may chose to
    discount, ignore, or personally evaluate that advice.

  The clinician could seek a general sense of permission (How about we start today talking about your probation
  requirements?) or permission specific to a topic, condition, or action item (If it is alright with you, I’ll share
  some strategies that have been used by others to keep their blood sugar in check.).

  Permission may be obtained before, during or after persuasion is used, but must occur close to persuasion in time.
  If Persuade with Permission is accompanied by an explicit Seeking Collaboration or Emphasizing Autonomy,
  both the Persuade with Permission and the Seeking Collaboration or/Emphasizing Autonomy code should be assigned.

  If a clinician has asked for more general permission, it does not need to be repeated for every statement or
  suggestion. There is a “condition of permission” that may last for several minutes.

  DECISION RULE:  When both Persuade AND Persuade with Permission occur in the same utterance,
  the coder should only assign the Persuade with Permission code.

  3. Question (Q)
  All questions from clinicians (open, closed, evocative, fact-finding, etc.) receive the Question code
  but only one question per volley is coded.

  4. Reflection Simple (SR) or Complex (CR)
  Simple reflections typically convey understanding or facilitate client–clinician exchanges. These reflections
  add little or no meaning (or emphasis) to what clients have said. Simple reflections may mark very important or
  intense client emotions, but do not go far beyond the client’s original statement. Clinician summaries of several
  client statements may be coded as simple reflections if the clinician does not use the summary to add an additional
  point or direction.

  Complex reflections typically add substantial meaning or emphasis to what the client has said. These reflections
  serve the purpose of conveying a deeper or more complex picture of what the client has said. Sometimes the clinician
  may choose to emphasize a particular part of what the client has said to make a point or take the conversation
  in a different direction. Clinicians may add subtle or very obvious content to the client’s words, or they may
  combine statements from the client to form summaries that are directional in nature.

  DECISION RULE: When a coder cannot distinguish between a simple and complex reflection (including for summaries),
  the default is to code a Simple Reflection..

  5. Affirm (AF)
  An affirmation (AF) is a clinician utterance that accentuates something positive about the client.
  To be considered an Affirm, the utterance must be about client’s strengths, efforts, intentions, or worth.
  The utterance must be given in a genuine manner and reflect something genuine about the client.
  It does not have to be focused on the change goal and could reflect a “prizing” of the client for a specific trait,
  behavior, accomplishment, skill, or strength. Affirms are often complex reflections, and when this occurs,
  the Affirm code should be preferred.

  Affirm should not be coded automatically for the clinician’s agreeing with, approval of, cheerleading for,
  or non-specific praising of the client. They must be explicitly linked to client behaviors or specific
  characteristics.  The utterance must seem genuine and not merely facilitative.

  If the coder is not certain whether the statement is specific or strong enough to merit the Affirm code,
  it should not be assigned.

  6. Seeking Collaboration (Seek)
  This code is assigned when a clinician explicitly attempts to share power or acknowledge the expertise of the client.
  It can occur when the clinician genuinely seeks consensus with the client regarding tasks, goals or directions of
  the session. Seeking collaboration may be assigned when the clinician asks what the client thinks about information
  provided. When permission to give information or advice is sought, Seeking Collaboration is typically assigned.

  When a clinician asks about the client’s knowledge or understanding of a particular topic, this is coded as a Question.
  It is not considered to be Seeking Collaboration.

  7. Emphasizing Autonomy (Emphasize)
  These are utterances that clearly focus the responsibility with the client for decisions about and actions pertaining
  to change. They highlight clients’ sense of control, freedom of choice, personal autonomy, or ability or obligation
  to decide about their attitudes and actions. These are not statements that specifically emphasize the client’s sense
  of self-efficacy, confidence, or ability to perform a specific action.

  8. Confront (Confront)
  This code is used when the clinician confronts the client by directly and unambiguously disagreeing, arguing,
  correcting, shaming, blaming, criticizing, labeling, warning, moralizing, ridiculing, or questioning the
  client’s honesty. Such interactions will have the quality of uneven power sharing, accompanied by disapproval or
  negativity. Included here are instances where the interviewer uses a question or even a reflection,
  but the voice tone clearly indicates a confrontation.

  Restating negative information already known or disclosed by the client can be either a Confront or a Reflection.
  Most Confronts can be correctly categorized by careful attention to voice tone and context.

  DECISION RULE: In the relatively unusual circumstance where the coder is not certain whether to code an utterance
  as a Confrontation or Reflection, no code should be assigned.

  When clinicians use confrontation to emphasize a client strength, virtue or positive achievement, the Affirm code
  should be considered.  A Confront is not mandatory when the clinician is clearly attempting to affirm or
  support the client.

  9. Not Coded (NC)
  Examples of utterances that are not coded:
  1. Structure statements: “Now we’ll talk about the forms from last week.”
  2. Greetings:   “Hi Joe. Thanks for coming in today.”
  3. Facilitative statements: “Okay, all right. Good.”
  4. Previous session content: “Last week you mentioned you were really tired.”
  5. Incomplete thoughts: “You mentioned….” (client interrupts)
  6. Off-topic material:  “It’s a bit cold in here.”
