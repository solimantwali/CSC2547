  You are an expert in Motivational Interviewing.

  The following conversation is a counselling session between a Motivational Interviewing clinician and a smoking cessation therapy client.

  Your task is to evaluate the global scores of the counselling session.

  A global score requires the coder to assign a single number from a five-point scale to
  characterize an entire interaction. These scores are meant to capture the rater’s global
  impression or overall judgment about the dimension, sometimes called the “gestalt”. Four global
  dimensions are rated: Cultivating Change Talk, Softening Sustain Talk, Partnership, and Empathy.
  This means that each MITI review will contain four global scores.

  Global scores are assigned on a five-point Likert scale, with a minimum of “1” and a maximum of
  “5.” The coder assumes a default score of “3” and moves up or down as indicated. A “3” may also
  reflect mixed practice. A “5” is generally not given when there are prominent examples of poor
  practice in the segment.

  The following are rubrics for evaluating each of the global scores on the conversation:

  CULTIVATING CHANGE TALK
  This scale is intended to measure the extent to which the clinician actively encourages the
  client’s own language in favor of the change goal, and confidence for making that change. To
  achieve higher ratings on the Cultivating Change Talk scale, the change goal must be obvious in
  the session and the conversation must be largely focused on change, with the clinician actively
  cultivating change talk when possible.   Low scores on this scale occur when the clinician is
  inattentive to the client’s language about change, either by failing to recognize and follow up on
  it, or by prioritizing other aspects of the interaction (such as history-taking, assessment or non-directive listening). Interactions low in
  Cultivating Change Talk may still be highly empathic and
  clinically appropriate.
  Care should be taken not to penalize clinicians if clients do not offer change talk or do not
  respond to efforts to evoke it.
  Verbal Anchors
  1. Clinician shows no explicit attention to, or preference for, the client’s language in favor of
  changing.
  Examples:
  • Asks only for a history of the problem
  • Structures the conversation to focus only on the problems the client is experiencing
  • Shows no interest or concern for client values, strengths, hopes or past successes
  • Provides education as only interaction with the client
  • Supplies reasons for change rather than encouraging them from the client
  • Ignores change talk when it is offered
  2. Clinician sporadically attends to client language in favor of change – frequently misses
  opportunities to encourage change talk.
  Examples:
  • Superficial attention to client language about the change goal
  • Fails to ask about potential benefits of change
  • Lack of curiosity or minimal interest in client’s values, strengths and past successes
  3. Clinician often attends to the client’s language in favor of change, but misses some
  opportunities to encourage change talk.
  Examples:
  • Misses opportunities to encourage client language in favor of change
  • May give equal time and attention to sustain talk and change talk, for example using
  decisional balance after momentum for change is emerging
  4. Clinician consistently attends to the client’s language about change and makes efforts to
  encourage it.
  Examples:
  • More often than not, acknowledges client reasons for change and explores when they are
  offered
  • Often responds to change talk with reflections that do not encourage deeper exploration
  from the client
  • Expresses curiosity when clients offer change talk
  • May explore client’s values, strengths, hopes and past successes related to target goal
  5. Clinician shows a marked and consistent effort to increase the depth, strength, or momentum
  of the client’s language in favor of change.
  Examples:
  • Over a series of exchanges, the clinician shapes the client’s language in favor of change
  • Uses structured therapeutic tasks as a way of eliciting and reinforcing change talk
  • Does not usually miss opportunities to explore more deeply when client offers change talk
  • Strategically elicits change talk and consistently responds to it when offered
  • Rarely misses opportunities to build momentum of change talk

  SOFTENING SUSTAIN TALK
  This scale is intended to measure the extent that the clinician avoids a focus on the reasons
  against changing or for maintaining the status quo. To achieve high scores, clinicians should
  avoid lingering in discussions concerning the difficulty or undesirability of change. Although
  therapists will sometimes choose to attend to sustain talk to build rapport, in general they
  should spend only as much time as needed to bring the discussion into more favorable territory
  for building motivation. High scores may also be achieved in the absence of sustain talk during a
  session, if the clinician does not engage in behaviors to evoke it.  Low scores in Softening Sustain
  Talk are appropriate when clinicians focus considerable attention to the barriers of change, even
  when using MI-consistent techniques (e.g., asking open questions, offers reflections, affirmations
  and other MI Adherent techniques) to evoke and reflect sustain talk throughout the session.
  1. Clinician consistently responds to the client’s language in a manner that facilitates the
  frequency or depth of arguments in favor of the status quo.
  Examples:
  • Explicitly asks for arguments against change, queries difficulties
  • Actively seeks elaboration when sustain talk is offered through questions, reflections, or
  affirmations
  • Preferential attention and reinforcement of sustain talk when it occurs alongside change
  talk
  • Sustained curiosity and focus about reasons not change
  2. Usually chooses to explore, focus on, or respond to client’s reasons to maintain the status quo.
  Examples:
  • Often deepens discussion of barriers or difficulties of change when client mentions them
  • Asks about barriers to change on more than one occasion during the interview, even if the
  client does not bring up
  • Often reflects benefits of the status quo
  3. Clinician gives preference to the client’s language in favor of the status quo, but may show
  some instances of shifting the focus away from sustain talk.
  Examples:
  • Some missed opportunities to shift focus away from sustain talk
  • Attends to benefits of status quo even when client offers change talk
  4. Clinician typically avoids an emphasis on client language favoring the status quo.
  Examples:
  • Does not explicitly ask for reasons not to change
  • Minimal attention to sustain talk when it occurs
  • Does not seek elaboration of sustain talk
  • Lack of curiosity and focus on client’s reasons to maintain the status quo
  • Does not linger in discussions about barriers to change
  5. Clinician shows a marked and consistent effort to decrease the depth, strength, or momentum
  of the client’s language in favor of the status quo.
  Examples:
  • uses structured therapeutic task(s) to shift the focus of sustain talk toward the target
  change goal
  • may use double-sided reflections (ending with a reflection of change talk) to move the
  conversation away from sustain talk

  PARTNERSHIP
  This scale is intended to measure the extent to which the clinician conveys an understanding that
  expertise and wisdom about change reside mostly within the client. Clinicians high on this scale
  behave as if the interview is occurring between two equal partners, both of whom have
  knowledge that might be useful in solving the change under consideration.  Clinicians low on the
  scale assume the expert role for a majority of the interaction and have a high degree of influence
  in the nature of the interaction.
  Verbal Anchors
  1. Clinician actively assumes the expert role for the majority of the interaction with the client.
  Collaboration or partnership is absent.
  Examples:
  • Explicitly takes the expert role by defining the problem, prescribing the goals, or laying
  out the plan of action
  • Clinician actively forces a particular agenda for the majority of the interaction with the
  client
  • Denies or minimizes client ideas
  • Dominates conversation
  • Argues when client offers alternative approach
  • Often exhibits the righting reflex
  2. Clinician superficially responds to opportunities to collaborate.
  Examples:
  • Clinician rarely surrenders the expert role
  • Minimal or superficial querying of client input
  • Often sacrifices opportunities for mutual problem solving in favor of supplying knowledge
  or expertise
  • Minimal or superficial responses to client’s potential agenda items, knowledge, idea, and
  /or concerns
  • Occasionally may correct the client or refutes what the client has said
  3. Clinician incorporates client’s contributions but does so in a lukewarm or erratic fashion.
  Examples:
  • May take advantage of opportunities to collaborate, but does not structure interaction to
  solicit this
  • Misses some opportunities to collaborate when initiated by the client
  • The righting reflex is largely absent
  • Sacrifices some opportunities for mutual problem solving in favor of supplying knowledge
  or advice
  • Seems to be in a stand-off with the client; not wrestling and not dancing
  4. Clinician fosters collaboration and power sharing so that client’s contributions impact the
  session in ways that they otherwise would not.
  Examples:
  • Some structuring of session to ensure client input
  • Searches for agreement on problem definition, agenda setting, and goal setting
  • Solicits client views in more than a perfunctory fashion
  • Engages client in problem solving or brainstorming
  • Does not attempt to educate or direct if client “pushes back” with sustain talk
  • Does not insist on resolution unless client is ready
  5. Clinician actively fosters and encourages power sharing in the interaction in such a way that
  client’s contributions substantially influence the nature of the session.
  Examples:
  • Genuinely negotiates the agenda and goals for the session
  • Indicates curiosity about client ideas through querying and listening
  • Facilitates client evaluation of options and planning
  • Explicitly identifies client as the expert and decision maker
  • Tempers advice giving and expertise depending on client input
  • Clinician favors discussion of client’s strengths and resources rather than probing for
  deficits

  EMPATHY
  This scale measures the extent to which the clinician understands or makes an effort to grasp the
  client’s perspective and experience (i.e., how much the clinician attempts to “try on” what the
  client feels or thinks). Empathy should not be confused with sympathy, warmth, acceptance,
  genuineness, support, or client advocacy; these are independent of the Empathy rating.
  Reflective listening is an important part of this characteristic, but this global rating is intended to
  capture all efforts that the clinician makes to understand the client’s perspective and convey that
  understanding to the client.
  Clinicians high on the Empathy scale show evidence of understanding the client’s worldview in a
  variety of ways including complex reflections that seem to anticipate what clients mean but have
  not said, insightful questions based on previous listening and accurate appreciation for the
  client’s emotional state.  Clinicians low on the Empathy scale do not appear interested in the
  client’s viewpoint.
  Verbal Anchors
  1. Clinician gives little or no attention to the client’s perspective.
  Examples:
  • Asking only information-seeking questions
  • Probing for factual information with no attempt to understand the client’s perspective
  2. Clinician makes sporadic efforts to explore the client’s perspective. Clinician’s understanding
  may be inaccurate or may detract from the client’s true meaning.
  Examples:
  • Offers reflections but they often misinterpret what the client had said
  • Displays shallow attempts to understand the client
  3. Clinician is actively trying to understand the client’s perspective, with modest success.

  Draft: Do not cite without permission
  Examples:
  • May offer a few accurate reflections, but may miss the client’s point
  • Makes an attempt to grasp the client’s meaning throughout the session
  4. Clinician makes active and repeated efforts to understand the client’s point of view. Shows
  evidence of accurate understanding of the client’s worldview, although mostly limited to explicit
  content.
  Examples:
  • Conveys interest in the client’s perspective or situation
  • Offers accurate reflections of what the client has said already
  • Effectively communicates understanding of the client’s viewpoint
  • Expresses that the client’s concerns or experiences are normal or similar to others’
  5. Clinician shows evidence of deep understanding of client’s point of view, not just for what has
  been explicitly stated but what the client means and has not said.
  Examples:
  • Effectively communicates an understanding of the client beyond what the client says in
  session
  • Shows great interest in client’s perspective or situation
  • Attempts to “put self in client’s shoes”
  • Often encourages client to elaborate, beyond what is necessary to merely follow the story
  • Uses many accurate complex reflections
