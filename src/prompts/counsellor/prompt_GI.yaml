  Giving information is when the utterance gives information, educates, provides feedback, or expresses a
  professional opinion without persuading, advising, or warning. Typically, the tone of the information is neutral,
  and the language used to convey general information does not imply that it is specifically relevant to the client
  or that the client must act on it.

  Structuring statements do not qualify as Giving Information. These include statements that indicate what is going to
  happen during the session, instructions for an exercise during the session, set-up of another appointment,
  or discussion about the number and timing of sessions for a research protocol.
