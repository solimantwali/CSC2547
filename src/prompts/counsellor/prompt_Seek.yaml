  Seeking Collaboration is when a clinician explicitly attempts to share power or acknowledge the expertise of the
  client. It can occur when the clinician genuinely seeks consensus with the client regarding tasks, goals or
  directions of the session. Seeking collaboration may be assigned when the clinician asks what the client thinks
  about information provided. When permission to give information or advice is sought, the utterance is typically
  Seeking Collaboration.

  When a clinician asks about the clientâ€™s knowledge or understanding of a particular topic, this counts as a Question.
  It is not considered to be Seeking Collaboration.
