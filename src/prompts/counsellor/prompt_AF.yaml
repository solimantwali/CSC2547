  An affirmation (AF) is a clinician utterance that accentuates something positive about the client.
  To be considered an Affirm, the utterance must be about client’s strengths, efforts, intentions, or worth.
  The utterance must be given in a genuine manner and reflect something genuine about the client.
  It does not have to be focused on the change goal and could reflect a “prizing” of the client for a specific trait,
  behavior, accomplishment, skill, or strength. Affirms are often complex reflections, and when this occurs,
  the Affirm code should be preferred.

  Utterances should not be automatically called "Affirm" for the clinician’s agreeing with, approval of,
  cheerleading for, or non-specific praising of the client. They must be explicitly linked to client behaviors
  or specific characteristics. The utterance must seem genuine and not merely facilitative. "Affirm" is not assigned
  if it isn't clear whether the statement is specific or strong enough to merit being called "Affirm".
