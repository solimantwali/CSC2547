  For your next turn of speech, ask a question in order to gather information, understand, or elicit the client's story.
  This question may also be stated in imperative statement language.
  The question can be open or closed, depending on what is appropriate for the context.

  An open question is when the interviewer asks a question that allows a wide range
  of possible answers. The question may seek information, may invite the client’s
  perspective or may encourage self-exploration. The open question allows the option of
  surprise for the questioner.

  A closed question is when the interviewer asks the client a question that can be
  answered with a “yes” or “no” or otherwise specific, restricted-range answer.
