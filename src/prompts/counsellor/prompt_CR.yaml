  Complex reflections typically add substantial meaning or emphasis to what the client has said. These reflections
  serve the purpose of conveying a deeper or more complex picture of what the client has said. Sometimes the clinician
  may choose to emphasize a particular part of what the client has said to make a point or take the conversation
  in a different direction. Clinicians may add subtle or very obvious content to the clientâ€™s words, or they may
  combine statements from the client to form summaries that are directional in nature.
