  Utterances that are emphasizing autonomy clearly focus the responsibility with the client for decisions about and
  actions pertaining to change. They highlight clients’ sense of control, freedom of choice, personal autonomy,
  or ability or obligation to decide about their attitudes and actions. These are not statements that specifically
  emphasize the client’s sense of self-efficacy, confidence, or ability to perform a specific action.
