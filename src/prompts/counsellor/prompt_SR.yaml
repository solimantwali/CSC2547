  Simple reflections typically convey understanding or facilitate client–clinician exchanges. These reflections
  add little or no meaning (or emphasis) to what clients have said. Simple reflections may mark very important or
  intense client emotions, but do not go far beyond the client’s original statement. Clinician summaries of several
  client statements may also count as simple reflections if the clinician does not use the summary to add an additional
  point or direction.
